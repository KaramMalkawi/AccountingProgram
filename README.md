# AccountingProgram

I recently developed a Java accounting program with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Swing library. This program allows users to input sales transactions and expenses, and it automatically calculates the net sales and tax. Here's a brief overview of its key components:

**Login Frame:** The application starts with a login frame, where users need to enter their username and password to access the main functionalities.

**Sales and Expenses Frame:** After successful login, users are presented with a frame to enter sales transactions and expenses.

**Sales Panel:** This panel handles the UI and logic for entering sales transactions. Users can input sales amounts, and the program validates the input to ensure it is a valid number.

**Expenses Panel:** Similarly, this panel allows users to input expenses. The program validates the input and displays an error message for invalid values.

**Calculate Button:** The frame includes a "Calculate" button, which triggers the calculation of net sales and tax based on the provided sales and expenses.

**Summary Panel:** After calculations, a summary panel displays the entered sales and expenses, along with the net sales and tax. It also provides additional messages based on the net sales value, such as warnings for negative net sales or congratulatory messages for excellent sales.

The application follows a simple and intuitive design, making it user-friendly and suitable for individuals or small businesses to manage their financial transactions effectively.
